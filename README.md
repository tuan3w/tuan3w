#  üëã Hi, I'm Tuan Nguyen

I love/hate building products.

## ‚ù§ Love products

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): My favorite personal tool. I use this for learning, thinking, and reflection.
I recommend everyone to build you own personal knoweldge base. You can start with [my template](https://github.com/tuan3w/obsidian-template). It's good for learning, personal growth and well-being.
- [Linear](https://linear.app/): I like their [opinionated approach](https://linear.app/method/introduction#opinionated-software) in building products. Adding features without much value sucks. Linear team tries to answer the fundamental questions in software development and they do it so well. There are things that I don't like very much in their product too, but it's amazing in general.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/): I've never been able to learn a professional tool like Photoshop. Figma surprises me that I can do it. They put a lot of care in their product. Figma is [professional, approachable, thoughtput tool](https://rsms.me/work/figma/). I can understand almost every concepts and even make myself a [prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/amOgLwFXhJdSkmIbbo0uuM/Linear.app-clone?type=design&node-id=2-5&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=4%3A131).
