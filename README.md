#  👋 Hi, I'm Tuan Nguyen

Product people with strong believe in using technology to support human. I love building consumer products (especial web-based products). 

I'm from Hanoi, Vietnam. I'm a technical leader with 7+ years experience specializing in back‐end development, large‐scale system design with willingness to learn about building great products. Have worked in both large company as well as startup in Vietnam, have designed and built some scalable systems, I have good understanding about product development and different technologies. I also have done research in Deep Learning as my personal interest since 2012 in Computer Vision and Speech Synthesis.
